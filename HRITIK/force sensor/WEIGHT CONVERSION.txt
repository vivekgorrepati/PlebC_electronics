put no load on your sensor and read out the value (ADCv),this is your offset. Store it in EEPROM of the controller.

put 1 kg on your sensor and calculate gain:

gain = 1000g / (ADCv - offset)

Store gain in EEPROM

calibration finished.

To measure:

Weight in gramms = gain * (ADCv - offset)

finished.
