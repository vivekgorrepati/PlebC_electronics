1. Encoder Feedback: By adding an external encoder to the stepper motor shaft, you can obtain position feedback. The encoder generates pulses or signals based on the motor shaft's actual position, allowing you to measure and track its movement accurately. The encoder can be connected to a feedback controller or a microcontroller to process the signals and provide position feedback.

2. Closed-Loop Control: Instead of using an open-loop control strategy, you can implement a closed-loop control system. This involves combining the stepper motor with an encoder or a sensor to measure the actual position. The control system continuously compares the desired position with the actual position and adjusts the stepper motor's steps accordingly to maintain accurate positioning.

3. Hybrid Stepper Motors: Hybrid stepper motors, such as hybrid servo motors, are designed to provide the benefits of both stepper motors and servo motors. They incorporate a built-in encoder or a sensor for position feedback. These motors are often driven by specialized control systems that use the position feedback to achieve accurate positioning.

4. Force/Torque Sensors: To obtain torque feedback, you can use force or torque sensors in the mechanical system where the stepper motor is applied. These sensors measure the forces or torques exerted by the motor and provide feedback on the actual torque output. This feedback can be used to monitor and control the motor's torque output
